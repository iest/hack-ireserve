> iPhone reservation availability notifier

https://hack-ireserve-ncbrszfugl.now.sh

I want to reserve a new iPhone for in-store pickup, but I don't want to wait around forever until there's greater availability â€” or have to check every morning at 6am or whatever they ask you to do.

So I built this bot to check for me. When availability changes, it [tweets at me](https://twitter.com/ireservehack/status/790671943812812800).
When the [phone I want](https://github.com/iest/hack-ireserve/blob/master/src/index.js#L12) is available, it tells me which stores it's available in.

Pretty dumb right? I kno
